# Train-Schedule
Homework for Week 4, my attempt at making a train schedule

In this assignment I have to create a train schedule that a user can create. It had to include a header, current train schedule, which included the train name, destination, frequency, next arrival, and how many minutes away it is. The last box had to include the form for the user to actually create.
